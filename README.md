# Initial Plan

## Technology details

### Possible stack
- Node.js
- Mocha
- Chai
- Travis (CI)
- Possible improvement: code coverage

### Possible tasks
- [x] Understand the problem
- [x] Creation of npm repo
- [ ] Completion of npm scripts
- [x] Enable test scripts
- [x] Creation of test cases
- [x] Introducing CI (Travis)
- [x] Creation of Table-top
- [x] Robot Controller (identify and create)
- [x] Command structure (analyze as per problem)
- [x] Command executor (implementation of comand structure)
- [-] Unknown (unclear) elements
- [x] Raise issues in GitHub
- [ ] Analyzing user interaction tools
- [ ] Test via integration of components

### Scenarios (discoveries)
- We are working on geometrical coordinates system to construct the table top instead of working in array dimensions
- Command will follow the point mention above
- Under geometrical coordinate system our edge cases will lie under (+,+) region
